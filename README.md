[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/jccriado/invariants.svg?token=FCho83xJ9cZySjbkvBWS&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/jccriado/invariants)

This is a program for computations with Lie algebra representations.
For any semisimple Lie algebra, it can:
- Obtain the weights (with multiplicities) of a representation given the highet
  weight.
- Decompose tensor products of irreducible representations (irreps) into a
  collection of irreps.
  
It also implements the calculation of bases of operators in effective field
theories:
- Find the number of invariants with a given field content.
- Compute bases of operators taking into account integration by parts and
  (optionally) the use of equations of motion.
